I am interested in learning more about data analytics, so I completed a course on datacamp.com where I learned how to code in R. I was intrigued by its simplicity and usefulness, so I decided to learn more about how R can be used to analyze data in a more meaningful way. I did some research and learned about the importance of decision trees, so I created this project using a tutorial online to program a decision tree using the Iris Data Set.
